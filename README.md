# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview

The following analysis was performed on PyBer's ride sharing business from January through April (inclusive) of 2019. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate how PyBer's business performs in urban, suburban, and rural areas to assist with decisions on where and how to expand the business going forward.

The summary above shows that while urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and per driver (when compared to rural and suburban cities), urban cities provided more than two times the total fares than either suburban or rural cities and accounted for the majority of the rides during the given timeframe. The two pie charts below further demonstrate this, showing that urban areas accounted for 62.7% of the total fares and 68.4% of the total rides. Of the remaining rides and resulting fares, suburban areas out-paced rural areas, even though rural areas had the highest average fares (both per ride and per driver).

## Summary

The three key takeaways from the analysis can be summarized as follows:

1. The largest amount of PyBer's business is centered around urban areas where there is a much larger clientele. Identifying new urban areas that PyBer can expand to is likely the fastest and most effective way to continue PyBer's growth.
2. PyBer's has been most successful in urban areas, however, not all urban areas are equally successful. Using the metric of number of rides per driver, two strategies can be derived:

    - In urban cities with the lowest demand (number of rides per driver), PyBer should focus on increasing the number of clients that it serves through a focused marketing campaign. Expansion in these areas will allow for more efficient growth, as much of the infrastructure needed is already in place.
    
    - Cities with a highest demand may not have enough drivers avaailable to meet demand. If PyBer recruits more drivers in these cities, there will be additional rides available at lower prices, allowing for quick growth in areas that are already providing large amounts of revenue to PyBer.

3. While urban areas continue to dominate PyBer's business, further expansion into suburban and rural areas can help solidify the business. Efforts should be made to increase awareness of PyBer's services in rural and suburban areas where the business is under-represented.
