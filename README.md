## Overview
_The purpose of the new analysis is well defined_
The following analysis was performed on PyBer's ride sharing business from January through April (inclusive) of 2019. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate how PyBer's business performs in urban, suburban, and rural areas to assist with decisions on where and how to expand the business going forward.


## Results
_There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type_

The summary above shows that while urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and per driver (when compared to rural and suburban cities), urban cities provided more than two times the total fares than either suburban or rural cities and accounted for the majority of the rides during the given timeframe. The two pie charts below further demonstrate this, showing that urban areas accounted for 62.7% of the total fares and 68.4% of the total rides. Of the remaining rides and resulting fares, suburban areas out-paced rural areas, even though rural areas had the highest average fares (both per ride and per driver).
